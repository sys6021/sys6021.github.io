    <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
            <p>What are the contributing factors to the severity of train accidents? How do you predict if an e-mail is spam? How can you translate goal-directed problems such as these into actionable decisions and meaningful recommendations that can have vast societal implications? How can you harness multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data to analyze the problem? In this course, we will explore Evidence Informed Systems Engineering (EISE) practices and how they can be applied to difficult, open-ended problems.<br />
             <br />The primary tools for EISE come from linear statistical models and this course demonstrates the use of these models for problem understanding, prediction, and control. We will learn how to formulate hypotheses, build statistical models to test them, and make recommendations based on our findings. These steps can be laden with biases, for example in the data available to test these hypotheses, and in the metrics used to assess success. We will learn how to identify and prevent these biases to ensure equitable outcomes.The specific topics that we will cover include data visualization, principal components, confidence intervals, regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and generalized linear models. We hope this course illustrates the value of statistical modeling and provides a foundation for future learning.<br />

          </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p id="labs" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
          <strong><b>Labs </b></strong>
          <p>The Labs consist of multiple choice questions that encourage and assess understanding of data analysis and R programming as discussed in the course material. These exercises must be submitted individually and include an honor pledge. However, you are encouraged to work with others on the completion of these exercises.</p>
        </p>
    
        <p id="hands-on activities" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
          <strong><b>Assignments </b></strong>
          <p>Assignments that provide open-ended problem solving experiences that illustrate the concepts of evidence-informed systems engineering. Hence, they provide the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of class material using real data to solve a goal-directed problem. Assignments are designed to teach students how to perform a detailed analysis as well as how to proficiently communicate results as in a technical document or client report.</p>
  <ul> 
    <li><span style='color: brown;'><strong><i>R Markdown Notebooks:</i></strong></span> Each assignment requires you to complete an individual R Markdown Notebook detailing your analysis and communicating your results. The format for each Notebook will be released for each homework. Be sure to reference all material used to complete the homework.</li>
            <li><strong><i><span style='color: brown;'>Submission:</span></i></strong> On the day an assignment is due you must submit an electronic copy of your R Markdown Notebook as well as a <strong><b>PDF (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</b></strong> version of the R Markdown Notebook on the Collab site and pledge your submission. The due dates and times for all assignments will be announced/posted on Collab. Only the instructor can grant exceptions to the due dates and this will normally be done in response to requests made prior to the due date or for true emergencies. Assignments submitted late will be penalized. In many cases you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.</li>
          </ul>      
  </p>
  
    
        <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
          <strong><b>Exams </b></strong>
  <p>The exams (one midterm and one final) are based entirely on classroom notes, readings, laboratory exercises, and laboratory sessions. The exams will contain a closed book section, on your honor, with short answer questions and an open book section requiring analytical problem solving.Example questions will be provided before the exams.</p>

        <strong><b>Illness: </b></strong> 
              <p>We try to create a safe environment, not only for our students, but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in 
                your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. I would rather you stay home and work something out with 
                me for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, please contact Student 
                Health for appropriate treatment or testing. </p>

        <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
              <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence 
                when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
              <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to us by private message on Piazza
                as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact 
                the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>

            <strong><b>Accessibility Statement: </b></strong> 
           <p>
            It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues 
            related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we 
            can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability 
            Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official 
            accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. 
            You may email her at <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu>cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. 
            For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. 
            If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter 
            and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

             <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
             <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
              <p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
              We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, 
              cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can 
              destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
              of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
              Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
              including the section on academic fraud." <br />
              <br />In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
              sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
              about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
              Regardless of circumstances we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
              of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
              as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
        what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

              <strong><b>The Use of Generative AI: </b></strong> 
      
               <p>
                Generative artificial intelligence tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, 
                video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and 
                DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester 
                together. You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to 
                do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. </p>
                
                <p>If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite the tool you used, following 
                the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief 
                description of how you used the tool. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are 
                typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained 
                on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result 
                in plagiarism or copyright violations. </p>
                
              <p>  Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce 
                content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, 
                relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not 
                the tool’s—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. If you use 
                generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I reserve
                the right to apply the Honor Code to your specific case. In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or 
                fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.
               </p>
              
              <p>In this course, the following policy dictates the acceptable use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT
                  and other similar technologies. This is a programming course and while I recognize that generative AI can
                  be a tremendous learning tool, it is my expectation that these technologies do not impede you learning 
                  the programming concepts taught in class.  However, these technologies can be used to enhance your
                  learning experience much like one would use Stack Overflow on assignments with the exception of on exams 
                  and lab quizzes which must be utilized without generative AI.

            <strong><b>Support for Career Development: </b></strong>
                <p>Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, 
                   attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your 
                   path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career 
                   development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.</p>

              an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural
              fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.</p>

        <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
      <p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
        If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
        that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
        <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
          UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
          marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
          religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
      <p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
        (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
        <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
          Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
      <p>As your professors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are
        responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
        to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
        support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
